# kamera

// ============================================================
// kamera.php
//
// Generates web pages for webcam images located in subdirectories named YYYYMMDD.
// Assumes filenames like "image-2015120209401201.jpg".
//
// The script started as a simple hack, then grew into this.
// Unfortunately, no framework like Bootstrap is used, and it is not responsive.
// And all text is hardcoded in Norwegian. Nice.
